```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Following the workbook

### Blocks of text

Single asterisk makes the text *italics*. Double asterisks makes the text **bold**.

Using hash or multiple creates.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

The more hashes, the smaller the heding.

To create a list you can use:

   * this is
   * a bullet
   * list of items

**or**

1. this is
2. a numbered
3. list of items

### Blocks of formatted code/output that are not executed

To show code without executing them, you write the code between two lines with six or more tildes ~

~~~~~
x <- 4
~~~~~

### Blocks of formatted code that may be executed

* They begin and end with a triple back tick `
* If the chunk is going to be **shown, executed** and its output **displayed** then just put {r} after the first back tick
* Inside the braces, you can put options such as:
* eval=TRUE if the code is to be **run**, FALSE if not
* echo=TRUE if the code is to be *shown**, FALSE if not
* results=TRUE if the output of the code is to be **displayed**, FALSE if not
* error=TRUE if error messages are to be displayed, rather than just crashing the knitting of the file.
* include=FALSE if the code is to be executed, but the code should not be dislplayed, the output should not be shown either

For example:

~~~~~~
```{r}
seq(1,10)
```
~~~~~~

Will display:

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
